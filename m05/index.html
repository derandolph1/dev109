    <!-- Exercise 1:  Modifying HTML content using Javascript
Copy the example from Chapter 1:  http://javascriptbook.com/code/c01/add-content.html (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. and do the following changes:

Create a webpage with only the HTML code as index.html
Create a css file with only the CSS code as week5.css. To link the CSS, remember to add the code in your head section: 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="name-of-you-css-file" />
Make sure your code validates the .html and .css
Create a js file with the following code as week5.js. And use this one, instead of the current one. To link the script use:
<script src="name-of-your-js-file"></script>
The javascript file should have:

alert:  Welcome user!
Create a variable message (var message;)
prompt:  Ask the user for the firstname and store it in variable firstname (var firstname;)
prompt:  Ask the user for the second name and store it in a variable lastname (var lastname;)
In the Message concatenate the firstname and lastname  (HINT:  Concatenation in Javascript is done by the + symbol).
Display message by using: 
document.write('<h3>' + message + '</h3>');-->
  </body>
</html>
